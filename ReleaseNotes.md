* Modified the IMAP BODYSTRUCTURE parser to allow NIL tokens for

  based on a part specifier string. (issue #130)

### MailKit 1.0.3

  of header fields to fetch instead of a HashSet<HeaderId> for
  developers that need the ability to request custom headers not
  defined in the HeaderId enum.

  that can be overridden.
